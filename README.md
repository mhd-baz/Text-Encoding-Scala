# Text-Encoding-Scala

This was a project that I did during my first year of Master's in France during the academic year 2021-2022.

It consists of implementing different encoding methods using Scala as a programing language. I implemented simple methods like **RLE** but also Statistics methods like the one of **Shannon Fano** or **Huffman**, and also some Dictionaries-based methods like **LZ78** or **LZW**.
